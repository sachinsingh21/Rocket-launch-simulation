# Rocket-launch-simulation
This an Open gl project of rocket launch simulation.

# “Rocket launch and Simulation”


#### Computer Graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games,

#### computer displays, and many specialized applications. Modelling, Geometric

#### processing, rendering geometric transformation, visibility, simulation of light

#### Animation of Lifelike characters, natural phenomena, their interactions and

#### surrounding environments are some of the applications of Computer Graphics.

#### This project aims to implement a rocket launch simulation using OpenGL, which is

#### an open-source cross platform interface for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It will also

#### allow user interactions using keyboard. Through this, we will be able to understand

#### important OpenGL functions and GLUT libraries. This project also familiarizes us

#### with implementing transformations like translation, rotation and scaling, properties

#### of light, movement etc. on different objects.

#### implemented on codeblocks.

#### Opengl must be installed.
